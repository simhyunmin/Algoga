## üìñ Project Introduction

**Digestive Health Travel Aid** is a mobile & web platform for travelers with chronic digestive disorders (ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Crohn's disease, etc.).

We aim to solve the difficulties faced by those suffering from digestive disorders while traveling abroad:
- Difficulty in determining the safety of unfamiliar foods
- Lack of information on alternative medications available locally
- Limited access to medical services due to language barriers
- Anxiety about how to handle emergency situations

Using the powerful AI technology of **Google Gemini API**, we provide personalized information and solutions in real-time. Currently, we are targeting Korean travelers, with the goal of global expansion in the future.
